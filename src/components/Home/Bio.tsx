        I am a software developer from the Netherlands. I love trying new things
        and experimenting with new technologies. While my initial focus was on
        front-end development using React, I am expanding my skillset towards
        fullstack development, slowly becoming proficient in both front-end and
        back-end development by learning about fullstack frameworks like Next.js
        and Remix. I am characterized by my enthusiasm and drive for continuous
        learning, always looking for new opportunities to learn.
